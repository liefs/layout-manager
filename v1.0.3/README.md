## Installation (two methods)

#### Method 1 - Easy Way:
DONT INSTALL ANYTHING: ADD ONE LINE TO YOUR HTML (23Kb)

```<script src="https://liefs.github.io/liefs-layout-manager.V1.0.3.min.js"></script>```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>title</title>
    <script src="https://liefs.github.io/liefs-layout-manager.V1.0.3.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Method 2 - NPM Way:

Npm install - note: `--global` and `--save-dev` make NO SENSE here.  Use `--save`

```JavaScript
npm install liefs-layout-manager --save
```
What Did That Do?

It created:  
`node_modules/liefs-layout-manager/` (a bunch of files - all sort of named index? with two outliers?)

Each of these files has a "name" - which implies "for import" (import/require)  
Each of these files has a "name_" - which implies "no import - html is loading this as src!"  

##### Typescript:
**index.ts** - This is where I put all my code complete with docs.  
Usage:

```javascript
import {H, L, I, h, v, Item, Container, Handler} from 'liefs-layout-manager';
```

**index.d.ts** - this was generated by Typescript - I hear it's helpful to include :)

##### Javascript:
**index.js** - This is generated by Typescript Compiler.  
Usage:
```javascript
var liefs = require('liefs-layout-manager');
var H = liefs.H, L=liefs.L, I=liefs.I, h=liefs.h, v=liefs.v, Item=liefs.Item,
    Container=liefs.Container, Handler=liefs.Handler;
```

**liefs-layout-manager.v1.0.0.min.js**  and **liefs-layout-manager.v1.0.0.js** - this is used when loaded DIRECTLY in html  
usage:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>title</title>
    <script src="liefs-layout-manager.v1.0.3.min.js"></script> <!-- ~23Kb min version-->
<!--<script src="liefs-layout-manager.v1.0.3.js"></script> --> <!-- ~80Kb full docs version -->
<!-- move these from ./node_modules/liefs-layout-manager/ to find a better home -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Beta - What does that even mean?

One day I woke up and had this idea for a layout manager. I threw together some code and liked it so much I invented the name 'Alpha Version'. In my mind this means "Hey! I made code and by some miracle it's working!" Then I made some docs for it and put it here: OLD ALPHA DOCS [http://liefs.paperplane.io/](http://liefs.paperplane.io/). - SO CURRENT BETA DOCS STILL HERE - [https://liefs.github.io/](https://liefs.github.io/) Then in the process of making these docs, I realized, " HEY! I can make it much better! "

So, I tore the code apart, and redesigned it in a way that made more sense... so more than "Gosh it worked, " I believe I have made substantial improvements. I like this version Far BETTER. Lets call It Beta.

Once we (you and I) have had time to " work out bugs " (we haven't hit that stage yet) then I will remove the Beta Tag. Until then, Enjoy!

## So Is This Code Safe To Use?

Yes - completely...  
However, that answer might change after 100,000 people try it and comment.

## What Can I expect in the future?

I am a one man show - docs/code

I will continue to improve this repo as much/fast as possible.

My current focus is improving the Docs (Code is Good For Today)

Expect a life long upgrade experience - at the speed of a one man show.

Contributors welcome.

Final Note: Special thanks to [http://typedoc.org/](http://typedoc.org/) community for making the docs for me!

... as a side note, the Irony making a layout manager, then NOT using it for the docs.... is not lost on me. Working on it.
